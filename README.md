# Fourier-Analysis

*Since simulations are conducted in the MATLAB environment using computers, all the signals involved in the simulations are discrete signals. Therefore, all the results must be consistent with the discrete domain. However, the discrete and continuous domains are closely related, and their concepts align with each other.*

*Frequency refers to variations in the time domain, and the Fourier transform is designed to take us from the time domain to the frequency domain. Therefore, the more pronounced the variations in the time domain, the higher-frequency components our function possesses. When we take the Fourier transform of it, higher frequencies become apparent in its Fourier transform.*

*What are the most severe changes in the time domain? Clearly, the most severe changes in the time domain are discontinuities. Thus, all functions that have discontinuities should include the highest frequencies in their Fourier transform. This means they must also encompass infinite positive and infinite negative frequencies. Furthermore, to represent these changes, a limited number of frequencies will not be sufficient for response. Therefore, their Fourier transform will only have value over a restricted portion of the frequency axis and must extend from -∞ to +∞.*
